## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration

Update `public/firebase-config.js` with your actual Firebase project configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 2. Firebase Functions Setup

Ensure your Firebase functions are properly configured:

```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 3. Run the Application

For development:
```bash
# Serve the application
firebase serve --only hosting

# Or use a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

For production deployment:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Firebase Config**: Make sure to update `firebase-config.js` with your actual project credentials
2. **HTTPS Required**: Google Auth requires HTTPS in production
3. **Functions**: Ensure your `generateProjectIdea` Firebase function is deployed
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support required

## 🎯 Key Features Preserved

- ✅ Google login popup functionality
- ✅ User authentication state management
- ✅ Firestore user data storage
- ✅ Project idea generation
- ✅ User profile loading
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

## 🔄 Migration from Original

The original vanilla JavaScript implementation has been replaced with:
- React components for better state management
- Modern UI with particle effects
- Improved user experience
- Better code organization and maintainability

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

1. **Firebase not initialized**: Check that `firebase-config.js` is loaded and configured correctly
2. **Login popup blocked**: Ensure popup blockers are disabled
3. **Particles not showing**: Check browser console for canvas errors
4. **Functions timeout**: Verify Firebase functions are deployed and accessible

## 📱 Browser Support

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

The application uses modern JavaScript features and requires a recent browser for optimal performance.
